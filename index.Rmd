# You can include section headers like this
## Or section subheaders like this
### How do I spend my time?

Motivation + primary questions of interest

blah blah blah

I can include an image (not created in R) like this:

![cute puppy](./img/cute_puppy.png)

Create a "img" folder within your calendar-project repo and store the image files there.

# Data collection

I collected data by . . . 

I can write a bulleted list like this:

- here's the first thing I want to say
- and I also want to say this
- lastly, this

And a numbered list like this:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

# Results

And here are my results . . .

> Question: How did my planned times differ before self-isolation/remote learning as compared to during self-isolation?
> ANSWER:
My calendar had way fewer items during the pandemic period.
Some items like sleep and Rest adn Relaxation (RnR) were assigned more time during the pandemic. 
A simple sum of time allocated showed that more hours of the week were allocated activities pre-pandemic than during the pandemic.(~ 14hrs more)

> Question: How did my planned times differfrom actaul time spent on activities?
> ANSWER: Planned time seemed to have been an underestimation of time required as I spent more time finishing most of  my homework assignemnts than I had planned. A lot of it was because I combined allocated meal time with homework completion thus there was overlap. Dinner and lunch times were also slightly shorter due to a few skipped meals here and there.

> Reflection: The whole process was much more fun than previous assignments because of the personal aspect to it. I gt the chance to actually use the skills I learnt in this class to analyze my dat-to-day. It was also amazing feeling how much easier it was to debug and find solutions for wht I wanted to do from the internet. Definitely an improvement from day1!
